# HDCodes

Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to view my HD Codes web portfolio project.

I started this project with the intention of becoming a front end web developer, then shifted my focus to UI/UX design, so I made edits accordingly. So far, I've made a detailed wireframe for this site using Figma and done a little bit of coding on the home page. Stay tuned for the final product!
